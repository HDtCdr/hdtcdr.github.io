			Hello, and welcome to my personal website. I'm Harrison Davison. On this page, you will find some of my personal projects and academic work, as well as general
			information about me. The site is still very much a work in progress, but hopefully it can provide a good glimpse into the kinds of things that interest me and what
			I am all about. Be sure to check back from time to time, as I frequently post new content.
