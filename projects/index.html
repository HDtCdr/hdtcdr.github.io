			<p>I was interested in computer programming from a young age. I created a website (which no longer exists) to publish personal projects. The game Pengy Slide was one such project. The player controls a sliding penguin who wants to avoid obstacles.</p></li>
			<li><h3><a href="pengy%20slide%202.exe">Pengy Slide 2</a></h3>
			<p>Pengy Slide 2 is the sequel to Pengy Slide. After falling down a waterfall, the protagonist finds themself in an underwater world full of octopuses. Can our heroic penguin escape, or will they meet an untimely end?</p></li>
