		<h1>Projects</h1>
		<h2>Mathematics</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><h3><a href="Extended%20Essay.pdf">Logarithmic Squircles</a></h3>
			<p>As part of the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program, candidates must write an extended essay on a subject of their choice. I elected to write a mathematics essay. The essay examines one particular type of intermediate shape between a square and a circle, which I named a "logarithmic squircle."</p></li>
			<li><h3><a href="Math%20IA.pdf">Factor-based Numeral System</a></h3>
			<p>In addition to the extended essay, every IB course requires students to write a smaller paper (an internal assessment) within the subject of the course. This essay is my internal assessment from Higher Level Mathematics AA. It concerns a numeral system based on prime factorization that I invented.</p></li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Programs</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><h3><a href="pengy%20slide.exe">Pengy Slide</a></h3>
			<p>At a young age, I became interested in computer programming. I subsequently created a now defunct website called penguinox7.com where I published several personal projects. The game Pengy Slide is one such creation, where the player controls a sliding penguin who wants to avoid obstacles.</p></li>
			<li><h3><a href="pengy%20slide%202.exe">Pengy Slide 2</a></h3>
			<p>Pengy Slide 2 is the sequel to Pengy Slide. After falling down a waterfall, the protagonist finds themself in an underwater world full of octopuses. Can our heroic penguin escape, or will they meet an untimely end?</p></li>
